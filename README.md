# Project Blog - Portfolio Website

## How It Works
1. The frontend is built with React and deployed on Netlify. It includes multiple pages:
   - Home Page
   - About Me
   - Projects
     - Book Recommender
     - Voice-Based Code Editor
   - Random Image Generator with the Pixabay API
2. The backend is built using Express.js and deployed on Render. It handles API requests for the Random Image Generator, getting data from the Pixabay API.
